# The-Football-Project
CMSC436 Final Project

To run this project, open up a terminal or command prompt and type:

pip install -r requirements.txt

to install the required libraries. Then you can run the command:

mercury run

to run the application in your local machine. Finally, open a web browser and
go to  http://127.0.0.1:8000 where you'll be able to interact with and create the visualizations.

If there are any issues you can run:

mercury add <path_to_notebook>

where <path_to_notebook> should be replaced by the file path to FootballProjectFinalVerision.ipynb. Then run:

mercury runserver --runworker

and then once again open a web browser and go to  http://127.0.0.1:8000 If you continue to experience issues
reach out to me at ti60490@umbc.edu
